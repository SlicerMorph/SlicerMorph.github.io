<b>Target Audience:</b> Course is directed for students, post-docs and junior faculty who are interested in conducting quantitative research into organismal form and function using 3D imaging. It is also appropriate for more established researchers who are looking for open-source alternatives to the proprietary pipelines they have been using. <p>

<b>Course Contents and Structure:</b> Due to change to online format and with shortened hours, course will prioritize hands-on contents and computer labs over formal didactics. Labs will cover all aspects of conducting specimen-based research using 3D imaging. Practical topics (e.g., image processing and segmentation, visualization) will be taught using the open-source 3D-Slicer visualization suite and the SlicerMorph morphometrics toolkit (statistical shape analysis).
Course material will be focused on volumetric (e.g., CT or microCT) 3D datasets, but will be equally applicable to data from 3D surface scanners. <p>

<b>Enrollment is limited to 45 attendees and is on first-come, first-serve basis </b>. <p>

<b>Computer requirements and course logistics:</b> Each attendee will have access to the SlicerMorphCloud virtual machines during the the workshop. All labs and tutorials can be completed using this cloud instance. However, we also encourage each attendee to have personal device like a laptop running Windows, Mac or Linux OSs (no netbooks or tablets) as a backup. Approximately a week before the workshop, there will be an online tech checkin session during which we will provide instructions about how to install SlicerMorph to your personal computer. <p>

<b>Course Timeline:</b> Course will run Monday from Friday. Each day will start at 9.30 and end at 2pm (Pacific Standard Time), with a 20 minute break in between.<p>


<b>Course Fee:</b> There is no course registration fee. This workshop and SlicerMorph project are supported by a collaborative research grant from the National Science Foundation Advances in Biological Informatics program (ABI-1759637, Adam Summers & Murat Maga). SlicerMorphCloud service is provided through an education grant from Microsoft Azure. <p>

<b>Contact information:</b> If you have any questions, please email us at SlicerMorph@outlook.com, and one of the course directors will respond to you inquiry. <hr>
